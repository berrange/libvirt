Libvirt Message Translation
===========================

Libvirt translatable messages are maintained using the GNU Gettext tools and
file formats, in combination with the Zanata web service.

Source repository
=================

The libvirt GIT repository stores the master "libvirt.pot" file and full "po"
files for translations. The master "libvirt.pot" file can be re-generated using

   make libvirt.pot

The full po files can have their source locations and msgids updated using

   make update-po

Normally these updates are only done when either refreshing translations from
Zanata, or when creating a new release.

Zanata web service
==================

The translation of libvirt messages has been outsourced to the Fedora
translation team using the Zanata web service:

  https://fedora.zanata.org/project/view/libvirt

As such, changes to translations will generally NOT be accepted as patches
directly to libvirt GIT. Any changes made to "$LANG.mini.po" files in libvirt
GIT will be overwritten & lost the next time content is imported from Zanata.

The master "libvirt.pot" file is periodically pushed to Zanata to provide the
translation team with content changes. New translated text is then periodically
pulled down from Zanata to update the po files.
